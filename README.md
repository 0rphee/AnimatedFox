## Requirements
 - An up-to-date version of Firefox or LibreWolf. Other Firefox derivatives might work but I haven't tested them.
 - [JetBrains Mono](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) installed on your system.
 - [Firefox Color extention](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-CA/firefox/addon/firefox-color/) added to your browser. (Optional)

## Installation
1. Make sure you have everything listed in Requirements.
2. Enable toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets in [about:config](about:config).
3. Add the userChrome.css file to your chrome folder.
 
    Go to [about:support](about:support), then find "Profile Directory." Press the "Open Folder" button, then create a folder named chrome. This is where the userChrome.css file goes.
4. Hide the bookmarks toolbar by pressing Ctrl+Shift+B or right clicking and selecting "Never Show."
5. Click [this link](https://color.firefox.com/?theme=XQAAAAKGAQAAAAAAAABBKYhm849SCia73laEGccwS-xMDPr5iE6wEt17lnFu4uAqMsdEr66zA4hyQFpjnIdIqexC6jk0ujxh3YezY5q8Yibz3vKnXSdVRwFGs8MGkNcRmXXkVBYSSb5AZytOH-ZH-2fJHXOM2cMauhgxI-owK6hf70XV6B-CNgSQ8ezEFHnV3IYDQizRHgzyz4-QTV3e2qMGHFZQ86mhpKNfHjKK6Ay7Rw6VO4ffFxgcOJhEOGZegOZPzluYPS3grJZyeCZz6Y1js48jUOlOXyXnJ9VOUhG__2C1sgA) to install the Firefox Color theme.
