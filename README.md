## Installation
1. Make sure you have everything listed in Requirements.

3. Add the userChrome.css file to your chrome folder.
 
    Go to [about:support](about:support), then find "Profile Directory." Press the "Open Folder" button, then create a folder named chrome. This is where the userChrome.css file goes.
4.

If you would like your tabs to be centered, set the option "minimal-gruvbox-material-firefox.centered-tabs" to true in about:config.

## Other color schemes
This theme might work with other color schemes, but I can't guarantee it. However, here are a few that I have tested:

Default Dark: Works well.
